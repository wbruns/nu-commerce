If you wish to contribute to this project, create a fork of my repository on GitHub: [nu-commerce](https://github.com/wbruns/nu-commerce). Then when you have made your changes create a merge request and I will look into adding your code as soon as I can.

## **Testing**

As mentioned you need to use Insomnia to interact with the routes and database.  You can test product/tag/category creation by inputting improper data.  You can also test the routes by searching for products/tags/categories that don't exist in the database!
